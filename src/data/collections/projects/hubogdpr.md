    Customers could start a request to edit, view, remove, limit processing or trasfer data (also opt-out possiblity). These actions and how they were related to specific data (not all data can be removed) had to be implemented dynamically. I implemented the complete customer flow to issue a request, everything you see as a normal non-admin user.
